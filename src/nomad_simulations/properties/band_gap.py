        Type categorization of the electronic band gap. This quantity is directly related with `momentum_transfer` as by
        definition, the electronic band gap is `'direct'` for zero momentum transfer (or if `momentum_transfer` is `None`) and `'indirect'`
        for finite momentum transfer.

        If the electronic band gap is `'indirect'`, the reciprocal momentum transfer for which the band gap is defined
        in units of the `reciprocal_lattice_vectors`. The initial and final momentum 3D vectors are given in the first
        and second element. Example, the momentum transfer in bulk Si2 happens between the Î“ and the (approximately)
        X points in the Brillouin zone; thus:
            `momentum_transfer = [[0, 0, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0]]`.
