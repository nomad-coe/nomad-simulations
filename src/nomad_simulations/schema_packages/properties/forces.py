    The inheritance from `PropertyContribution` allows to link this contribution to a
    specific component (of class `BaseModelMethod`) of the over `ModelMethod` using the
    `model_method_ref` quantity.

    For example, for a force field calculation, the `model_method_ref` may point to a
    particular potential type (e.g., a Lennard-Jones potential between atom types X and Y),
    while for a DFT calculation, it may point to a particular electronic interaction term
    (e.g., 'XC' for the exchange-correlation term, or 'Hartree' for the Hartree term).
    Then, the contribution will be named according to this model component and the `value`
    quantity will contain the force contribution from this component evaluated over all
    relevant atoms or electrons or as a function of them.
